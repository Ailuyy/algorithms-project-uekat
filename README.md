#Hunting cats!
This project involves developing a simulation in which three cats—Ariana, Luna, and Dante—hunt for objects within a defined territory, each with specific preferences and limited time and space. 
The tasks involve solving various algorithmic challenges to optimize their hunting routes and territory division based on their unique preferences.
